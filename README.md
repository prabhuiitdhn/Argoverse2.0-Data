# Argoverse2.0-Data
This is for argoverse2.0 data understanding. Motion forecasting data is being explored.

Argoverse 2.0 data understanding for Motion forecasting (250K scenarios for Training and validation, each scenarios contains 11secs long).

https://www.argoverse.org/av2.html

Argoverse2.0 data contains HD maps from US cities Austin, Detroit, Miami, Pittsburgh, Palo Alto, and Washington, D.C

Argoverse 2 Motion Forecasting Dataset: contains 250,000 scenarios with trajectory data for many object types. This dataset improves upon the Argoverse 1 Motion Forecasting Dataset.

Vector Map: Lane-level geometry: lane boundaries, lane marking types, traffic direction, crosswalks, driveable area polygons, and intersection annotations.

Lane boundaries: Dashed white, dashed yellow, double yellow Crosswalks: Purple Intersection: grey Path of ego vehicle: red

Argoverse data understanding could be used for Training vectornet for trajectory prediction.
